 Telephone Diary 


We need to create one diary app for user.
when user open app it display menu for operation 
e.g

1 Add new Contact
2 Edit Contact
3 Search Contact 
4 Remove Contact 
5 Exit From App 


1 Add contact will add new contact in app. we need to store first name last name and phone number of user. 
2 Edit contact will modify user info.  user can search via firstname once user found then only edit function will work
3 when user want to contact any person user can use this functionality, he can add first name of user and your app will list all users with matching first name 
4  remove contact will remove contact from app user can remove contact via first name , if multiple user found then app need to confirm which user need to be deleted , you have to manage this by your own way 
5 exit :)
