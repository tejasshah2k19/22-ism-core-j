10) mysql 

11) take an array of 5 numbers. 
    create right shift function which takes 1 argument countShift.
    if countShift is 1 and your array is a = [1,2,3,4,5] 
    output : 5 1 2 3 4 
    
    if countShift is 3 and your array is a = [1,2,3,4,5]
    output: 3 4 5 1 2

	Student 
			-studentId 
			-name 
			-email
			-password 
			
	when any student registered studentId will automatically assign 
	an unique number. 
	name email and password will input by student. 
	
    create two methods 1) input 2) print

 Telephone Diary 


We need to create one diary app for user.
when user open app it display menu for operation 
e.g

1 Add new Contact

1 Add contact will add new contact in app. we need to store first name last name and phone number of user. 
2 Edit contact will modify user info.  user can search via firstname once user found then only edit function will work
3 when user want to contact any person user can use this functionality, he can add first name of user and your app will list all users with matching first name 
4  remove contact will remove contact from app user can remove contact via first name , if multiple user found then app need to confirm which user need to be deleted , you have to manage this by your own way
